                    <h4>Pekohe’s Need</h4>
                    <p>When Pekohe approached DataHawk in October of 2020, it was early days for the company. They had launched on Amazon, and were looking for a partner to help them grow on the marketplace.</p>
                    <p>Given their unique product, DataHawk decided to put skin in the game and offered Managed Services, with the objective of complete Amazon Account Management for Pekohe.</p>
                    <p><strong>In a nut-shell, DataHawk’s goals would be:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To increase Pekohe’s sales on Amazon</li>
                        <li>To improve their margins on Amazon</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>And in order to achieve the afore-listed, DataHawk would:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve Pekohe’s organic visibility</li>
                        <li>Improve their sponsored visibility</li>
                        <li>Lower their ACoS & TACoS, consequently increasing their RoAS & Blended RoAS</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ofcourse, all of these are easier said than done. Unless you’re using DataHawk. In which case, it’s easy as pie. Well, that might be a stretch, but you get the idea.</p>

                <div class="content-descriptions">
                    <h4>The Process</h4>
                    <p><strong>In order to improve Pekohe’s organic visibility, DataHawk took a multi-pronged approach:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="process-listing">
                        <li>
                            <span>SEO:</span> Given that 90% of product page views result from organic searches, SEO still remains the bread & butter of Amazon selling. To be truly successful on the hyper-competitive marketplace, it’s imperative to excel at SEO. To that end, DataHawk focused on the following for Pekohe:
                        </li>
                        <li><span>Content / PDP Optimization:</span> By studying Keyword Ranks for both, Pekohe as well as competing products, and thereafter also analyzing the latter’s PDPs,  DataHawk provided data-driven recommendations on Product Detail Page content around the Title, Description, Bullet Points, A+ Content, and Back-End Search Terms. Essentially, by studying the correlations between Keyword Ranks and PDP content, we were able to determine which keywords, used where on the PDPs, would drive the best results for Pekohe..</li>
                        <li><span>Organic Ranks Optimization:</span> DataHawk’s systems capture the market dynamics for every single tracked keyword. We know how the trifecta of Price, Ratings & Star Ratings impacts products’ organic ranks for any given (tracked) keyword. That allows us to make data-driven recommendations on actions around (i) Pricing Strategy, (ii) Ads Strategy, and (iii) Content Strategy to optimize organic ranks and generate increased organic traffic and sales</li>
                        <li><span>Optimizing Back-End Search Terms:</span> Though invisible on the front-end, the importance of back-end search terms cannot be overstated. These are a great way to help display your product for relevant search terms, after you’ve reached Amazon’s character thresholds on the front-end.</li>
                        <li><span>Advertising:</span> Though small, Advertising is a really powerful tool. Not only does it boost sales in the short term, it actually boosts products’ organic rankings in the long term. In order to boost Pekohe’s Sponsored visibility, DataHawk engaged in the following: </li>
                        <li><span>Judicious Bidding:</span> We reviewed top-performing customer search terms based on historical ads. We looked at those which had High Impressions + High CTR + Low CPS, and doubled-down on those in terms of bids.</li>
                        <li><span>Bid Optimisation:</span> We increased Phrase Match Bids on keywords for which Pekohe wasn’t consistently ranking on Page 1 of search results as a Sponsored Product.</li>
                        <li><span>Organic Rank Reclamation:</span> We increased Phrase Match Bids on keywords for which Pekohe’s rank had fallen significantly behind the best-ever rank, organically speaking.</li>
                        <li><span>Competitors Conquesting:</span> DataHawk’s Market Research tool tracks the best selling products across 20,000 Amazon categories. As such, surfacing competition requires only a couple clicks! We uncovered Pekohe’s direct & ancillary competitors in the Plant Germination Kits category on Amazon, and launched campaigns showing Pekohe on competing PDPs, with the goal of driving traffic away from their pages to ours.</li>
                        <li><span>Sponsored Brand Video Targeting:</span> Pekohe already had a beautiful product and a video to flaunt it. And everyone loves videos! We thought, why not take the video to the shoppers, and show them that (thanks to Pekohe) growing food could be effortless, while also making the home look beautiful. As such, we launched Sponsored Brand Video Targeting, letting Pekohe speak for itself.</li>
                    </ul>
